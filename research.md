## Metallicity

In Astrophysics, elements beside H or He are considered to be metals.

```
Z = 1 - X - Y
```

- Measure of how much of its mass contains elements that are not H and He
- Z is metallicity 
- X is the fraction of star that is Hydrogen
- Y is the fraction of star that is Helium

Another common way of measuring metallicity is by looking at the ratio of Iron
to Hydrogen relative to the Sun.

```
[Fe/H]_star = log(N_Fe / N_H)_star - log(N_Fe / N_H)_sun
```

- N is the number of atoms per unit volume for a given element

### Metallicity of the Sun

For the sun:

- `Z = 0.0134`;
- `[Fe/H]_Sun \approx 0`.

## Deep Mixing


## Fusion with in Stars


### Hydrogen Burning

Hydrogen 

### Helium Burning

Helium burns via a process known as the Triple-Alpha Process
```
3 He-4 -> C-12 + Gamma Ray
```

The stars that we are interested about do not have sufficient mass to undergo
Carbon burning (fusing Carbon into heavier elements).

## Importance of Carbon and Lithium within Red Giants


### Carbon

### Lithium
Lithium has an atomic number of 3

- The two naturally occuring isotopes Li-6 and Li-7 are both stable isotopes.
	- Other isotopes are unstable, e.g. Li-4, Li-8 and Li-9.
- Can be easily destroyed via proton capture as Li-8 is less stable that He-4,
  so will decay to 2 He-4 instead of becoming Li-8.
- Lithium abundance is an indication of the abundance at formation.

// NOTE TO SELF: CHECK THE NUCLEAR EQUATION BELOW
```
H-1 + Li-7 = 2 * He-4
```
The formation of Li can be due to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cameron-Fowler Mechanism.
```
He-3 + He-4 -> Be-7 + gamma
Be-7 + e^-1 -> Li-7 + electron neutrino
```



## Galah and Apogee

- The relevant data sources are from Galah (Australia) and Apogee (America).


## Research Topic

The dependency of Carbon and Lithium depletion in Red Giants on the metallicity and mas of stars.

- Interested in stars with a mass of 0.7 - 2.5 solar masses.
