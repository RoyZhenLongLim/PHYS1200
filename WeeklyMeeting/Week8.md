## Questions

## Goals for next week

- Continue with APOGEE analysis
  - AGB/ low carbon stars
    - Read wiki on AGB
    - Graph overlapping graph for low C/N stars
  - Deep Mixing
    - Recalculate dC/N/dlogg 
      - dC/N before and after line
        - start with +- .1 log g
        - take an average and find gradient using it
    - Different Isochrome -> different timing
      - Put in discussion
  - Radial velocity
    - 'VHELIO_AVG'
  - Seaborn

- GALAH
  - Include in appendix 
  - Show general trend and explain limitations
