# Week 10

## Progress
- Wrote more of the report

## Questions to ask

- Selecting red giants
- Recommanded references?
- First, second and third dredge up?
	+ Timeline?
- Confirm
	+ Globular Clusters
	+ AGB stars
		* dont really understand what AGB stars are
	+ RGBb (not sure what it means) 


RGBb
- Make a histogram
	+ Luminosity 
	+ Looks like a bump (and hence the name)
	+ Depends on metallicity and mass
- Just had the hydrogen shell burn through mean molecular weight barrier
- Once the barrier is broken, fusion becomes more easier hence an increase in luminosity

First Dredge up
- Main sequence -> Red Giant
- First Dredge Up occurs when the convective envelope as the star 
- No He burning yet but outside the core shell of H that is burning
- Once H starts burning, first dredge up occurs. This chances the structure of the stars to stop convection.
- At this point, the outer core mean molecular weight barrier is thoroughly mixed due to first dredge up
- H shell is surrounded by H -> Dropped temperature -> Slows downs the evolution of the star
- Deep Mixing after occurs the RGBb bump
- He begins to burn and deep mixing ends when the helium flash


Mass and Metallicity
- Mass -> Higher mass -> less deep mixing and there should be a mass where deep mixing does not occur due to the RGBb lifetime is so short that the H shell doesn't reach
- Metallicity -> lower -> more deep mixing (low metallicity stars evolve faster, efficient carbon destroyers)
- C->N fast but N->O is slow


AGB stars
- Been through all of Deep Mixing and First Dredge Up



## Goals for next week

- Get some bibliography going
- Get a presentation done (should be easy after we have done the report)
- Send in a draft for feedback
