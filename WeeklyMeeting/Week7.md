# Week 7 

## Progress
- Included more variables in saved data
  - This took forever due to a minor bug that I found :/
- Determine that outliers in Carbon/Nitrogen to Surface Gravity is due to a globular cluster (primarily)
- Deep Mixing Analysis
  - Not sold on my methodology

## Questions

- For GALAH, what does `red_alpha_fe` mean?
  - I think the `red` part means reduced 
  - Not sure if this will make a difference
- For APOGEE:
  - Could find a flag that corresponds directly to radial velocity.
    - Found multiple and not sure which should be used
    - I think `rv_chi2` is the best estimate but need to confirm (https://www.sdss.org/dr16/irspec/radialvelocities/)
  - `ALPHA_M`
    - This seems to be abundance of alpha elements rather than alpha abundance, is this ok?
  - `targ_pmra` vs `gaiaedr3_pmra`
    - What's the difference?
    - Going with `gaiaedr3_pmra` since its is more precise
- See Deep Mixing APOGEE
  - Not sure why there is a split between main group of stars and stars with higher temperature.
- Ask about how to approach writing the research report.
  - How does the bibliograph work?
