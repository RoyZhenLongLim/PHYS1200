## Questions to ask

Train a new model for the GALAH Stars
Steps

- Train new model for the mass
    + APOKSAC train model for APOGEE
        * Clean it to get similar masses stars
        * Difficult because ML be easily swayed
        * APOKSAC don't overlap
    + K2 train model for APOGEE and GALAH
        * K2 + APOGEE
        * APOKSAC + APOGEE
        * K2 + GALAH
        * Compare the distribution of mass
    + Same distribution of masses for Apogee and GALAH (expected results)
        * Use same parameters as Chris
            - Oxygen Abundance is not as apparent in GALAH (might need to tweak the parameters)
            - Function of metallicity and mass -> Deep Mixing
                + First Dredge up - Can be used to predict mass
            - Uses the first 4 parameters to see how mass prediction gets affected
