# Week 5 & 6

## Progress Made

- Finishing creating data for APOKSAC mass prediction by merging APOKSAC and APOGEE data
  - Created RFR and Polynomial Regression model for APOKSAC mass prediction
  - Determine the appropriate `log g` required is around 3-3.5 Solar Masses for APOGEE

## Questions

- Not sure how to handle K2 data
  - EPIC ID is not
    - Source_id
    - Kepler Id
  - Not sure how to link EPIC id to a relevant column such that we can merge it with the GALAH dataset
    - Astroquery doesn't seem to have
- Lithium
  - Unsure about the expected Lithium changes
    - Lithium Abundance is observed to decrease
