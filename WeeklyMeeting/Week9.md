# Week 9

## Progress
- Extracted rotational velocity
- Redid plot with rotational velocity
- Redid plot with overlapping positions

# Questions
- How much do I need to write for everything?
  - LaTeX
- AGB stars
  - I don't think we have sufficient proof
- How does first dredge up related to deep mixing?
  - How does the process differ in time?
  - First Dredge Up (convective envelope gets bigger)
    - Affected by the time taken for hydrogen shell fusion
    - Faster it happens the less first dredge up affects surface abundance
    - Function of mass + metallicity
  - Deep Mixing



RGB bump doesnt occur in high mass stars
Expect in fig 13, expect low CN starsa to be at the top rather than evenly spread
