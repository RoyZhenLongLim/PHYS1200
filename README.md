## Potential Projects

- Deep Mixing
  - Part of the CNO Cycle 
  - Hydrogen Burning Shell 
    - Dependent on the metallicity of the star
    - Everything else other than H and He is considered a metal
    - Don't know the mass dependency
      - Stars above 2 Solar Masses should not 
    - .7  - 2.5 solar masses are in the dataset
  - Carbon Abundance
  - Have a look at Apogee and look
  - Lithium
    - Very easy to make
    - Easy to do
      - Lithium turns to helium
    - Should fall off
    - Decline might be different from Carbon

- Extension of the project
  - Few models that we can look at

## Astrophysics
