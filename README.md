Supervisor: Sarah Martell

## Projects Intro

The project aims to further research into a topic done by a previous Honours student.

- Topic: Investigating the dependence of deep mixing in red giants on mass and metallicity

When this project was initially done, the lack of data meant the model created was unable to match the observed mixing rate.

- The hopes are the new Galah Survey coupled with the Apogee data will allow the research into this phenomenon to be
  furthered.
- This project will provide astrophysicists and astronomers to understand the chemical evolution of stars and galaxies
  better.
